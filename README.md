#### By _Seth Gonzales_

#### _A C# / ASP.NET Core MVC application using Entity Framework Core and MySQL._

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET 6
* ASP.NET Core MVC
* Entity Framework Core
* MySQL
* MySQL Workbench

## Description

This application organizes and builds a repository of Cuisine Categories, Recipes, and their Tags, storing this information using a database. Users may create an account, log in and be assigned Admin or User roles. Registered users may create and edit their own recipes. Admin users may edit all recipes and assign/manage roles for all users. Anonymous users may read details of each category, recipe, and tag, while not having full CRUD capabilities. This project follows object oriented design and object relational mapping. This is an ASP.NET Core MVC application that uses Identity.

## Setup and Installation Requirements

### Setting up the project
* Before starting, check that all required technologies are used. For more information on configuring [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) and [MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/), follow the links provided.
* Navigate to the repository for Recipe Book on [GitHub](https://github.com/sethgonzales/Recipe_Book.Solution).
* Clone the repository down using `$ git clone https://github.com/sethgonzales/Recipe_Book.Solution.git` in your terminal.
* Within the production directory `RecipeBook`, create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
* Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `database`, `uid`, and `pwd` values with your own database name, username, and password for MySQL.
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=YOUR_DATABASE;uid=YOUR_USERNAME;pwd=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
  }
}
```

### Setting up the database
* If not already configured, install the Entity Framework Core tool `dotnet-ef`Â using the command `$ dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0` in your terminal. This will allow for data migrations and updates to the project's database.

### Running the project
* Navigate to this project's production directory `RecipeBook`.
* Recreate the database by running the command `$ dotnet ef database update` in your terminal.
* Navigate to your MySQLWorkbench to double check that your database has been built without error.
* In the command line, run the command `$ dotnet run` or `$ dotnet watch run` to compile and execute the application.
   * To compile the application without running it, use the following command: `$ dotnet build`.
* Begin populating your database. Use navigational links for quick access to different pages.
